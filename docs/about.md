My name is Jonathan and im studying a master in information technology at Lund University. In my freetime I mostly work part time at a larger tech company in Sweden.
Im writting this blog mainly for fun, but I'd also like to share my knowledge regarding everything from software developing and sourdough bread baking.

Thank you for taking the time to visit my blog and getting to know me a little better. I look forward to sharing my passions and experiences with you and engaging in thoughtful discussions. Whether you're a fellow software developer or sourdough bread enthusiast, I hope you'll find something here that interests you. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or just want to say hello. Happy reading!

My name is Jonathan and I'm studying for a master's in Information and Communication Engineering technologies at Lund University. In my free time, I mostly work part-time at a larger tech company in Sweden.
I'm writing this blog mainly for fun, but I'd also like to share my knowledge regarding everything from software development to Linux tools.

I look forward to sharing my passions and experiences with you and engaging in thoughtful discussions. Whether you're a fellow software developer or just passing by, I hope you'll find something here that interests you. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or just want to say hello. Happy reading!

I've always been fascinated by Tamagotchis as a kid, and although I never had one for myself, I vividly remember when my dad finally got me a pokéwalker. For those who don't know, it's a Tamagotchi with a pokémon inside it. I would strap it along my belt and walk around the house trying to gather steps and eventually get the pokémon to evolve.

Even though I liked pokémon a lot as a kid, I always had a soft spot for Digimon. It, like pokémon, is a Japanese anime about digital monsters going on adventures together. The excitement of seeing them on tv every day is something I'll never forget. That's why I decided to combine these two interesting concepts into a project!


To give myself a challenge, I decided to write the project in C++ as I had prior experience with the C language. Knowing the graphics would be a pain to code myself, I scoured the internet for such a library and ended up with `SFML`.

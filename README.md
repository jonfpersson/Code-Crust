# Code & Crust: A personal blog about diverse tech topics

The aim of this project is simply to write articles about tech topics and share my knowledge with the world.

## Technologies

This site is built using Jekyll. Markdown and HTML are used by Jekyll to generate a static site based on a layout. Github pages are used to host the website as support for it is built-in.
